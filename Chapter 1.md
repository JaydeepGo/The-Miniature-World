# The Experiment # Chapter 1 



Somewhere in {Isolate place name}. The {Species} is working on {new technology} that can shape their future. 
In the lab: The Science team and the King {Name} are present in the room to conduct the final experiment.

 1. The science team runs into errors during the final testing phase. Everyone in the room is tense and looking for reasons that can cause these errors.
 2. The science team is going through final checks before the experiment and everything seems fine. The Senior scientist {SS name} orders to start the experiment. The Countdown begins 6..5..4..3..2..1..0 as soon as it ends, the whole lab shuts down. Everyone in the room is tense and looking for the reasons that caused this.

One of the scientists pointed out that they were running out of energy and need more. 
After consulting with the [King], the [SS] orders the team to redirect all the energy to the experimentâ€™s energy source. 
Meanwhile, the [King] makes an announcement to his people-to maintain the peace.   
**Power redirection done!!**  
The [SS] Reinitiates the process. Countdown begins 6..5..4..3..2..1..0 this time the whole {Miniature world} goes into darkness.   
[SS] "Even after using all {Miniature World} energy, we can't power this experiment"   
***(emotion - frustrated)***. Everyone is exhausted and disappointed in themself.   

Suddenly a young intern in the team suggested that why don't we increase the energy sources to power our experiment. ***Everyone in the team looks (emotion - angry on a young intern)***.   
[SS] "Can't you see we've already used all the possible energy sources available on {Miniature world}".   
[Young Intern] "Yeah, I know but what if we bring more energy sources from the earth to power this experiment".  

[SS] "Traveling to earth is banned because of the risk of exposing ourselves to humans. If that happens, it can put our existence in danger".  
 1. [King] "We can launch a stealth mission to bring extra needed energy sources".
 2. [King] "Is there anyone who can travel to earth and complete this mission without exposing our existence?"
 3. [King] "There must be someone who can pull this kind of job. Search for the potential names that can travel to earth and complete this mission".
