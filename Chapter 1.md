# The Experiment # Chapter 1 



Somewhere in [Isolate place name]. The [Species] working on [new technology] that can shape their future. 
In the lab: The Science Team and King [Name] present in the room to conduct the final experiment.

 1. The science team is working on the experiment run into errors during the final testing phase. Everyone in the room is tense and looking for reasons that can cause these errors.
 2. The science team is going through final checks before the experiment and everything looks fine. The Senior scientist [SS name] orders to start the experiment. Countdown begins 6..5..4..3..2..1..0 the whole lab shuts down. Everyone in the room is tense and looking for the reasons that can cause this.

One of the scientists pointed out that we’re running out of energy, we need more energy. 
After consulting with [King], [SS] orders to redirect all the power source energy we have, to the experiment’s power source. 
Meanwhile [King] makes an announcement to his people to keep the peace. ***Power redirection done!!*** [SS] Reinitiates the process. Countdown begins 6..5..4..3..2..1..0 this time whole [Miniature world] goes into darkness. 
[SS] Even after using all [Miniature World] energy, we can't power this experiment *{emotion - frustrated}*. Everyone is exhausted and disappointed in themself. 

Suddenly a young intern in the team suggested that why don't we increase the energy sources to power our experiment. *Everyone in the team looks {emotion - angry on young intern}*. 
[SS] Can't you see we already used all the possible energy source available on [Miniature world]. [Young Intern] Yeah, I know but what if we bring more energy sources from the earth to power this experiment.
