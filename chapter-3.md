# Quantum Teleportation # Chapter 3

"Hey all, I can help you but in my way" Maithili replied to [SS]'s Message.

[SS] "I already told that dealing with her always waste of time, i knew her ways".

[King] "We need her, but i don't know what is the dispute between her and you, why you always call her mad?"

[SS] "Because of her quantum entanglement theory, she says that we can teleport the inforamtions with the more speed then light's. but i know this is all assumptions and not practically possible."

[SS] "i defenatly know she will use her theories in this mission."

[Young-Intern] "Sorry, for cutting your conversation, but i worked with her in my initial internship days, her mind is really awesome, i know quantum teleportation is untill not tested practically, but we need to give her one chance! "

[King] "He is saying right [SS], this mission is very important for us, we need to travel in future and put  Veritate in safe."

[SS] "ok (^_^)(Not satisfying emotion)."
